# Energy Data project

## Overview

The goal is to develop an interactive dashboard that provides real-time and forecasted carbon intensity data for electricity across the UK. Users will be able to select their specific region on a map and view a detailed breakdown of the energy generation sources in that area.

Additional features:

1. Electricity Pricing Data: Display current electricity prices alongside carbon intensity information.
2. Suggested Energy Usage Periods: Advise users on the most cost-effective and environmentally friendly times to use electricity
3. Smart Device Control: Integrate smart household devices, enabling them to automatically turn on or off based on the suggested energy usage periods, optimising both energy efficiency and costs.

## Data

The data used in this project will come from National Grid & Oxford Universities Carbon Intensity API: https://carbonintensity.org.uk/ and Electricity Maps Carbon API: https://www.electricitymaps.com/free-tier-api

## Key Technologies

- **Python** Core language.
- **SQL**: For structured data storage, retrieval, and manipulation.
- **Linux Server**: Deployment of webpage and Cron task scheduler
